Project Title:  Barcode - The Inventory Management Mobile Barcode Scanner
https://github.com/dsimmon1/theInventory.git

Barcode is an app that was created to enable mobile receiving of inventory items. The application runs on iOS and when the app is launched, the user can begin scanning inventory items (all items with a barcode) and then click "receive" to update the inventory database of TFIMS (theinventoryproject.herokuapp.com).

The applications functionalities are as follows:

Individual login
